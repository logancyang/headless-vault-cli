# vaultctl-wrapper - SSH forced-command wrapper for vaultctl
#
# This script is used as the forced command in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
# to restrict SSH access to only vaultctl commands.
#
# Usage in authorized_keys:
#   command="/path/to/vaultctl-wrapper",no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding ssh-ed25519 AAAA...
#
# The wrapper:
#   1. Reads SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND (the command the client tried to run)
#   2. Validates it starts with "vaultctl"
#   3. Executes the command if valid, rejects otherwise
#
