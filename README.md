# headless-vault-cli

Let your remote Moltbot read and write to your local Markdown vault — securely.

## 🤔 What is this?

If you run Moltbot on a server, it can't access notes on your laptop out-of-the-box. This tool creates a secure bridge so your bot can read and write Markdown notes in a specific folder on your local machine (macOS or Linux).

**How it works:** Your local machine connects to your bot server and keeps a secure channel open. The bot can only run a specific set of commands (`vaultctl`) — it cannot access other files or run arbitrary programs.

### 📝 To Obsidian and Other Notetaking App Users
When running Moltbot on a remote server, the Moltbot-bundled obsidian-cli doesn't fully work because many operations require the Obsidian GUI app to be installed in its environment. This headless-vault-cli is the workaround — it lets the remote bot operate on your local folder. Best part: no Obsidian app or vault required! It works with any folder of markdown files.

## ✨ Features

- **Safe Remote Access**: The remote bot can only access your notes folder, nothing else.
- **No App Needed**: Works with any markdown folder, no Obsidian or other note-taking app needed.
- **Non-destructive**: Only create and append operations — no delete or overwrite — so you can sleep tight even if you set your bot loose.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Setup requires two parts: **VPS** (where Moltbot runs) and **Local Machine** (Mac or Linux, where your notes live).

---

### ☁️ On VPS

#### 1. Install the skill

```bash
clawdhub install headless-vault-cli
```

#### 2. Get your SSH public key

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

If you get "No such file", generate a key first:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "moltbot"
# Press Enter 3 times to accept defaults (no passphrase)
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

You'll see something like:
```
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAI... user@vps
```

Copy this key — you'll need it for the local machine setup.

---

### 💻 On Local Machine (Mac or Linux)

#### 3. Enable SSH Server

**macOS:**
1. Open **System Settings** → **General** → **Sharing**
2. Turn on **Remote Login**
3. Under "Allow access for", select your user or "All users"

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**
```bash
sudo apt install openssh-server
sudo systemctl enable --now ssh
```

**Linux (Fedora/RHEL):**
```bash
sudo dnf install openssh-server
sudo systemctl enable --now sshd
```

#### 4. Install vaultctl

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logancyang/headless-vault-cli/master/setup.sh | bash -s -- <path-to-vault>
```

Replace `<path-to-vault>` with your notes folder, e.g. `~/Notes` or `~/Documents/MyVault`.

Or manually:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/logancyang/headless-vault-cli.git
cd headless-vault-cli
./install.sh <path-to-vault>
```

#### 5. Test locally

```bash
vaultctl tree
```

#### 6. Add the VPS key to authorized_keys

Open (or create) the authorized_keys file:
```bash
vim ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Add this line (all on one line), replacing `<PASTE_VPS_KEY_HERE>` with the key you copied from step 2:
```
command="/usr/local/bin/vaultctl-wrapper",no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding <PASTE_VPS_KEY_HERE>
```

So the full line looks like:
```
command="/usr/local/bin/vaultctl-wrapper",no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAI... user@vps
```

Save and exit (`:wq` then Enter).

**Important:** Fix permissions (SSH ignores the file if others can read it):
```bash
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

**What this does:** The `command=` prefix restricts this key so it can *only* run vaultctl — even if someone has the key, they can't get a shell or run other commands.

#### 7. Start the reverse tunnel

**Option A: Manual (for testing)**
```bash
ssh -N -R 2222:localhost:22 \
    -o ServerAliveInterval=30 \
    -o ServerAliveCountMax=3 \
    -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes \
    user@your-vps.com
```

The keepalive options detect and kill dead connections within 90 seconds, preventing zombie tunnels.

**Option B: Persistent (auto-reconnect)**

**macOS (launchd):**
```bash
./setup/tunnel-setup.sh <vps_user> <vps_host> [port]
# Example:
./setup/tunnel-setup.sh deploy my-vps.example.com 2222
```

This installs a launchd service that starts on login, auto-reconnects if connection drops, and logs to `/tmp/vaultctl-tunnel.log`.

**Linux (systemd):**
```bash
./setup/tunnel-setup-linux.sh <vps_user> <vps_host> [port]
# Example:
./setup/tunnel-setup-linux.sh deploy my-vps.example.com 2222
```

This installs a systemd user service. To keep it running after logout:
```bash
sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER
```

---

### ☁️ On VPS

#### 8. Test the connection

```bash
ssh -p 2222 <local-username>@localhost vaultctl tree
```

Replace `<local-username>` with your local machine username. To find it, run `whoami` on your Mac/Linux.

Example:
```bash
ssh -p 2222 logan@localhost vaultctl tree
```

If that works, your Moltbot can now access your notes!

## 📋 Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `tree` | List vault structure | `vaultctl tree --depth 2` |
| `resolve` | Find note by path or title | `vaultctl resolve --title "Meeting"` |
| `info` | Get file metadata | `vaultctl info Projects/Plan.md` |
| `read` | Read entire note | `vaultctl read Projects/Plan.md` |
| `create` | Create new note | `vaultctl create Notes/New.md "# Title"` |
| `append` | Append to note | `vaultctl append Notes/Log.md "Entry"` |
| `set-root` | Change vault directory | `vaultctl set-root ~/NewNotes` |

All commands output JSON to stdout. Errors go to stderr with exit code 1 (user error) or 2 (system error).

## 📄 Example Output

```bash
$ vaultctl tree
{"tree": [{"path": "Notes", "type": "dir"}, {"path": "Notes/Ideas.md", "type": "file"}, {"path": "Projects", "type": "dir"}, {"path": "Projects/Plan.md", "type": "file"}]}

$ vaultctl info Projects/Plan.md
{"path": "/Users/me/Notes/Projects/Plan.md", "lines": 42, "bytes": 1337, "sha256": "abc123...", "mtime": 1706000000}

$ vaultctl read Projects/Plan.md
{"path": "/Users/me/Notes/Projects/Plan.md", "content": "# Project Plan\n\n..."}
```

## 🔒 Security

- **Forced-command**: SSH key can only run `vaultctl`, not arbitrary commands
- **Path sandboxing**: All paths validated inside `VAULT_ROOT`
- **No shell access**: Bot cannot run `rm`, `curl`, etc.
- **Non-destructive**: No delete or overwrite commands

## ⚙️ Configuration

### 📁 Changing your vault folder

The vault path is configured automatically during installation and stored in `~/.config/vaultctl/config`.

**Option 1: Use the set-root command (recommended)**
```bash
vaultctl set-root <path-to-vault>
```

**Option 2: Re-run the installer**
```bash
./install.sh <path-to-vault>
```

### 🌐 Environment variables

These are automatically configured during setup. You don't need to set them manually.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `VAULT_ROOT` | Path to vault directory | Set during install |
| `VAULTCTL_PATH` | Path to vaultctl binary | `/usr/local/bin/vaultctl` |
| `VAULTCTL_LOG` | Log file for wrapper | `/tmp/vaultctl.log` |

Config file location: `~/.config/vaultctl/config`

## 🔄 Updating

When a new version is released, update both parts:

### ☁️ On VPS

```bash
clawdhub update headless-vault-cli
```

Then start a new Moltbot session (skills are snapshotted at session start).

### 💻 On Local Machine (Mac or Linux)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logancyang/headless-vault-cli/master/setup.sh | bash -s -- <path-to-vault>
```

Replace `<path-to-vault>` with your notes folder. Same command for install and update.

## 📦 Requirements

- macOS (tested on Ventura+) or Linux (Ubuntu 22.04+)
- Python 3.9+
